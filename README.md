ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @johnnyturpin-aow

AOW stands for "All One Word" - which is how I became known during my internship at Apple way back when... It was one of the first nights out "on the town" after arriving in California for my internship and we were going to a rave (because of course - it was the 90s - that whats you did) - and while doing rave stuff, I met this group of strangers (pretty girls) who asked me what my name was - and me being slightly awkward, blurted out "johnnyturpin" - which caught them offguard a bit... they thought it was funny or cute or whatever, but for the rest of the night they referred to me as "johnnyturpin - its all one word". Some coworkers were with me that night and also got a kick out of "johnnyturpin its all one word" - and from then on I became "johnnyturpin its all one word" - my business cards were even printed up as "johnnyturpin"

My day job is a freelance App developer, currently working on tvOS applications for Minerva Networks, Inc.

I am also a musician, currently enjoy studying drums, but also have a small bedroom studio full of synthesizers, effects, modular gear, guitars and lots of fun things.

I was somehow in the right place at the right time and was invited to work on the Catapult Entertainment XBand online gaming system back in mid 90s as the sound designer and musician. Here is a cool documentary about that amazing project:

One the weekends you can find me at my local hillybilly airstrip flying planes without any engines like this beautiful vintage SGS 1-26:
